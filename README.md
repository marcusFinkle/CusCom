# CusCom
Custom commands I use and link into my Linux distros to help with management.

Run the install.sh(not there yet) file after cloning or downloading to install the CusCom library.

CusCom is a package of a bunch of shell scripts I write and think are useful, of which can be called
manually or like commands if you choose to allow that to occur.

The autosudo command is really nice, but you need to store your password in plaintext in order to do so.
I am working on a way of hashing or encrypting it somehow but until then you need to create a file called
sudoPasswd in the CusCom directory, a plaintext file consisting of purely your password. This is optional.
